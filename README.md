# Create-Model-Using-Simple-Linear-Rigression
# Simple Linear Regression
* Linear Regression fits a linear model with coefficients B = (B1, ..., Bn) to minimize the 'residual sum of squares' between the actual value y in the dataset, and the predicted value yhat using linear approximation.

# Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:
* Use scikit-learn to implement simple Linear Regression
* Create a model, train it, test it and use the model

We have downloaded a fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. Dataset source

* MODELYEAR e.g. 2014
* MAKE e.g. Acura
* MODEL e.g. ILX
* VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV
* ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7
* CYLINDERS e.g 6
* TRANSMISSION e.g. A6
* FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9
* FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9
* FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2
* CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0
